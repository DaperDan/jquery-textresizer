jQuery Text Resizer Plugin
==========================
For documentation, please visit the official [jQuery Text Resizer Plugin project page.] (http://angstrey.com/index.php/projects/jquery-text-resizer-plugin/)

##Status of Project
* **2013-05-11**: I last worked on this project in September of 2009. Therefore, as of today I'm working on adding additional enhancements to the plugin, including support for the latest versions of its dependencies.

##Dependecies
jQuery Text Resizer is compatible with the following:
* [jQuery 1.3.2 or later] (http://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery Cookie 1.0 or later] (http://plugins.jquery.com/cookie/)

##Important Note
This plugin distributes the above dependencies due to the demos included with the plugin. You do not have to use the included dependencies. In fact, I strongly discourage you.
