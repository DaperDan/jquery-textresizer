jQuery Text Resizer Plugin
==========================
For documentation, please visit the official [jQuery Text Resizer Plugin project page.] (http://angstrey.com/index.php/projects/jquery-text-resizer-plugin/)

##Status of Project
* **2013-05-11**: I'm working on adding additional enhancements to the plugin, including support for the latest versions of its dependencies.

##Dependecies
* [jQuery 1.3.2 or later] (http://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery Cookie 1.0] (http://plugins.jquery.com/cookie/)

##Note
This plugin distributes the above dependencies due to the demos included with the plugin. You do not have to use the included dependencies. In fact, I strongly discourage you.

##Disclaimer
I've never tested **jQuery Text Resizer** with the latest versions of **jQuery** and the **jQuery Cookie** plugin (1.9/2.0 and 1.3.x, respectively, at time of writing). Use at your own risk.
