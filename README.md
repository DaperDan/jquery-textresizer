jQuery Text Resizer Plugin
==========================

For documentation, please visit the official [jQuery Text Resizer Plugin project page.] (http://angstrey.com/index.php/projects/jquery-text-resizer-plugin/)

##Status of Project
2013-05-11: I'm working on adding additional enhancements to the plugin and will also try to avoid including its dependencies as distributables if possible. I know it's easier with jQuery by downloading it from a CDN.

##Dependecies
jQuery 1.3.2 or later
jQuery Cookie 1.0

##Note
This plugin distributes the above dependencies due to the demos included with the plugin. You do not have to use them. 

##Disclaimer
I've never tested jQuery Text Resizer with the latest versions of jQuery (1.9 and 2.0) and the jQuery Cookie plugin (1.3.x at time of writing). Use at your own risk.
